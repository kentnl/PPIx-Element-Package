PPIx::Element::Package

This module aims to determine the scope any "PPI::Element" ( which
includes "Nodes" and "Tokens" ) is defined in.

It provides two utility methods as follows:

"identify_package" - The Logical "PPI::Statement::Package" that owns the
"Element"
"identify_package_namespace" - The name-space of the logical
"PPI::Statement::Package" that owns the element.

The latter of these is just a convenience wrapper on top of "x_package"
that returns "main" when either the owning "Statement::Package" cannot
be found, or when the owning "Statement::Package"'s name-space is
somehow undefined.
